**📌 Project: Predicting Student Performance Using Multiple Linear Regression 🚀📊
📖 Overview:
This project explores how study hours and previous academic scores influence a student's Performance Index using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The goal is to build a predictive model that helps analyze key factors impacting student success.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and trend analysis
✅ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and data splitting
✅ Model Training & Evaluation: Implementing MLR, calculating R² score, MAE, and RMSE
✅ Predictions: Estimating performance for different study patterns
✅ Residual Analysis: Checking model assumptions and accuracy

🛠️ Tech Stack:
📌 Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn**
